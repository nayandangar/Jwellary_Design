                        <p>The round, brilliant-cut diamond is by far the most popular choice. For almost 100 years,
                            diamond cutters have been using advanced theories of light behavior and precise mathematical
                            calculations to optimize the fire and brilliance in a round diamond and it accounts for more
                            than 75% of all diamonds sold globally. <a title="Certified Round Diamonds" href="#"

                        <p>After round diamonds, this is the most preferred shape and is quite popular in India. Its
                            beautiful brilliance and unique cut makes it a favorite for engagement rings. The princess
                            has pointed corners and is traditionally square in shape. The symmetry criteria is quite
                            important here as it will determine the shape of the diamond. For a princess diamond that is
                            square, the ideal length-to-width ratios are between 1 and 1.05.&nbsp;<a

                                <p>The weight of diamonds is measured in carats and it denotes the size of a diamond.
                                    Diamond
                                    prices increase exponentially with the increase in weight. So, a 2-carat diamond of
                                    certain
                                    quality will be priced at more than twice the price of a 1-carat diamond of the same
                                    quality. "Carat‚Äù is not to be confused with "karat," which is used to indicate the
                                    purity of
                                    gold. The size of a diamond, for a specific shape, is directly proportional to the
                                    carat-weight of a diamond.</p>
                                <p>One carat is subdivided into 100 "points". Therefore a diamond measuring 75 points is
                                    3/4
                                    carat in weight, or 0.75ct. 5 carats equal 1 gram, 0.200gm equals 1 carat.</p>

                                </h3>
                                <p>This depends on the preferences and the budget. Differences in
                                    size&nbsp;are&nbsp;clearly
                                    visible even to the untrained eye, and weight clearly does matter because it
                                    influences cost
                                    significantly. However, size alone does not guarantee beauty. The quality of a
                                    diamond in
                                    cut, color and clarity should also be considered. It is possible to buy a
                                    larger-sized,
                                    lower quality diamond in the same budget as compared to a much smaller-sized, higher

                                    diamond, depending upon the buyer‚Äôs preferences. Once you've selected your cut,

                                    clarity grade, it's easy to determine the carat weight of diamond that will fit
                                    within your

                                    <li>It is important to measure the distance across the top of the diamond as this is

                                        view a stone when set into jewelry. So, check the ‚Äòmm‚Äô measurements of the
                                        diamond you
                                        are interested in buying.</li>
                                    <li>Diamond prices jump at the full- and half-carat weights like 0.50, 1.00, 1.50
                                        etc.
                                        Diamonds just below these weights cost significantly less, and, because carat

                                        distributed across the entirety of the diamond, small size differences are
                                        almost
                                        impossible to detect.</li>
                                    <li>Keep in mind that the smaller the finger, the larger the diamond will appear. A
                                        1.50-carat diamond solitaire looks much larger on a size 8 finger than a size

                                            we actually are referring to the degree of colorlessness in a diamond. Many

                                    <p>Fluorescence is an important factor influencing the color of a diamond.
                                        Fluorescence can
                                        be
                                        observed in a diamond when it is exposed to ultraviolet light (such as lighting
                                        in
                                        nightclubs).
                                        Under normal lighting conditions, this fluorescence effect is generally not
                                        detectable
                                        to the
                                        naked eye. Generally, diamonds with a high degree of fluorescence are considered
                                        undesirable and
                                        are cheaper than diamonds with no fluorescence. However, some people prefer
                                        diamonds
                                        with
                                        fluorescence; it‚Äôs a matter of aesthetics really. If the fluorescence intensity
                                        is
                                        ‚ÄòStrong‚Äô or
                                        ‚ÄòVery Strong‚Äô, then the diamond tends to have a milky or oily look and is much
                                        cheaper
                                        than a
                                        diamond with None fluorescence.</p>
                                    <p>For yellow-tinted diamonds, especially in the color ranges J-K-L-M, diamonds with
                                        fluorescence
                                        seem to have a better color i.e. they appear to be whiter than a similar color
                                        diamond
                                        with no
                                        fluorescence. So, if you are looking to buy a diamond in these color ranges, it
                                        might be
                                        a good
                                        idea to get a diamond with fluorescence intensity of Faint Slight even Medium

                                        <li>It is important to keep in mind the metal color of the jewelry for which the
                                            diamond
                                            is to
                                            be purchased. If it is yellow gold, then it might be prudent to buy I color
                                            or lower
                                            since a
                                            higher color will also appear yellowish because of the yellow gold
                                            reflections.
                                            Similarly,
                                            for white gold or platinum jewelry, you can consider buying F-G-H color.

                                            can be
                                            significant. The more visible color differences are between D color and G
                                            color and
                                            G color

                                        <li>As diamond size increases, color becomes more noticeable. This is especially

                                                in a diamond.
                                                The

                                                Inclusions are interior irregularities and blemishes are exterior
                                                irregularities. These
                                                imperfections are not flaws, but rather the natural fingerprint of every
                                                diamond. Often,

                                                diamond of Good or Fair cut may be an acceptable choice. While the
                                                diamond will lack the

                                            <p>It is easy to be misled on cut quality, especially for diamonds that are
                                                not certified.
                                                Sometimes, customers are shown two-three qualities of diamonds but even
                                                the best quality
                                                might
                                                not represent the best cut available. Also, another major mistake is
                                                buying deeply-cut
                                                diamonds.
                                                A deeply cut diamond carries more of its carat weight "hidden" in the
                                                depth of the
                                                diamond as
                                                opposed to the width. These poorly cut diamonds are less expensive per
                                                carat, and are
                                                common in
                                                most jewelry stores. A customer might purchase a 1.00 carat diamond that
                                                actually looks
                                                like a
                                                .90 carat diamond because it is too deeply cut. Our experts recommend
                                                buying diamonds

                                                produced when a
                                                diamond is
                                                tilted from side to side. These flashes are caused when light that isn't

                                                most pronounced in

                                                bending and
                                                dispersion of

                                                colours will appear.&nbsp; This effect is greater in darker areas where
                                                there are fewer

                                                a diamond's pavilion must have accurate angles and depth. If the angle

                                            <p>An uncertified diamond is not accompanied by a diamond grading report,
                                                and therefore its
                                                stated
                                                quality is based only on the word of the seller. It is not necessarily a
                                                bad diamond;
                                                certainly,
                                                it can be as beautiful as its certified counterpart. However, if you
                                                cannot judge it‚Äôs

                                                yourself, you have to rely on someone else to assure you of its quality
